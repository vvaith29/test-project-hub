The issue i am facing is that we are a banking project which involves to test large numbers of transaction using the file which will be injected to the DB through java code. The issue is that when we were able to the injection we are able to do only 20 files per minute which is 1200 files per hour, but our requirement grew and we have now to do more than 1200 files per hour . What we thought is that by doing parallel execution though multithreading is feasible using Hikari CP jar and Executor service as thread pool. But we are unbale to recognize whether it is working or not also we just tested by importing this jar and not with the actual code implemented on top of that.


Thanks for the detailed explanation! You're working on a **high-throughput banking transaction ingestion system**, and your current file-to-database ingestion rate is **20 files per minute (1,200 files/hour)**. But now you need to scale it **beyond 1,200 files/hour**, which means you'll need to **optimize or parallelize** your ingestion process.

You've already considered using:
- ‚úÖ **Multithreading**
- ‚úÖ **ExecutorService** as thread pool
- ‚úÖ **HikariCP connection pool**

That's the right direction. Let‚Äôs walk through this step by step.

## üîç Step 1: Understand Your Current Bottleneck

Before jumping into multithreading, we must identify **where the bottleneck lies**:

### Possible bottlenecks:
1. **File Reading / Parsing**
   - Are you reading/parsing files sequentially?
   - Is parsing logic CPU-intensive?

2. **Database Insertion**
   - Are you inserting one record at a time in a loop?
   - Are you using prepared statements efficiently?
   - Is your database schema optimized? Any missing indexes?

3. **Single-threaded Java Code**
   - Is each file processed by only one thread?
   - Are DB inserts done serially?

4. **Database Connection Pooling**
   - Are you waiting for connections because of a small pool size?

5. **Hardware/Infrastructure Limitations**
   - CPU, RAM, Disk I/O, or network speed limitations?

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Step 2: Optimize What You Already Have

Before going full multithreaded, let's make sure the baseline is efficient:

### ‚úîÔ∏è Optimize File Processing
- Use buffered readers.
- Avoid unnecessary object creation inside loops.
- Consider using NIO (`Files.readLines` or `BufferedReader` with `Files.lines()`).

### ‚úîÔ∏è Optimize Database Inserts
- Use **batch inserts** instead of single-row inserts.
- Example using `PreparedStatement.addBatch()` and `executeBatch()`.
- Make sure you are committing in batches (not too often, not never).
- Ensure proper use of transactions.

#### Batch Insert Example:
```java
String sql = "INSERT INTO transactions (col1, col2) VALUES (?, ?)";
try (Connection conn = dataSource.getConnection();
     PreparedStatement ps = conn.prepareStatement(sql)) {

    for (Transaction t : transactions) {
        ps.setString(1, t.getCol1());
        ps.setBigDecimal(2, t.getCol2());
        ps.addBatch();
    }

    ps.executeBatch(); // execute all at once
    conn.commit();

} catch (SQLException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

---

## üßµ Step 3: Introduce Multithreading with ExecutorService

Use an `ExecutorService` to process multiple files concurrently.

### ‚úîÔ∏è Sample Thread Pool Setup:
```java
int corePoolSize = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors() * 2; // Tune based on load
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(corePoolSize);
```

Then submit tasks:
```java
List<File> files = getFilesToProcess();

for (File file : files) {
    executor.submit(() -> processFile(file));
}
```

Make sure `processFile()` handles:
- File parsing
- DB insertion (using batch insert)

---

## üêü Step 4: Use HikariCP Properly

Using HikariCP correctly is key to avoid DB bottleneck.

### ‚úîÔ∏è Sample HikariCP Configuration:
```java
HikariConfig config = new HikariConfig();
config.setJdbcUrl("jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:xe");
config.setUsername("user");
config.setPassword("password");
config.setMaximumPoolSize(20); // Adjust based on DB capacity
config.setMinimumIdle(5);
config.setIdleTimeout(600000);
config.setMaxLifetime(1800000);

HikariDataSource dataSource = new HikariDataSource(config);
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Don't do this:
```java
new HikariDataSource(config); // Always reuse the same instance!
```

---

## üìä Step 5: Monitor & Measure Performance

### To verify if multithreading + HikariCP is working:
1. **Log timestamps**: Add logs before and after processing a file.
2. **Monitor DB connections**: Use Oracle views like `v$session` or `v$process`.
3. **Use profiling tools**: VisualVM, JConsole, or even simple `System.currentTimeMillis()` logs.

### Example logging:
```java
long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
// process file
long end = System.currentTimeMillis();
System.out.println("Processed " + filename + " in " + (end - start) + " ms");
```

---

## üöÄ Step 6: Scale Further If Needed

Once you‚Äôve optimized:
- Increase thread pool size gradually.
- Monitor DB performance (CPU, memory, locks).
- Consider **asynchronous processing** (e.g., Kafka, message queues).
- Consider **parallel stream** (but be cautious with DB access).
- Use **bulk data loading** tools like SQL*Loader or Oracle Data Pump for very large volumes.

Okay Before jumping into multi threading , Should need to learn what is Multi threading and i know the basics of threading. Suggest me that the thread count which we are passing should match the cpu thredss alos?


Absolutely! That's a **great question**, and you're thinking in the right direction. Before jumping into multithreading, it's important to understand how threads relate to CPU resources and how to choose the optimal number of threads for your workload.

---

## üß† What is Multithreading?

**Multithreading** allows concurrent execution of multiple parts (threads) of a program for maximum utilization of the CPU. In Java, each thread is managed by the JVM and scheduled by the operating system.

### Types of Workloads:
1. **CPU-bound tasks**  
   - Tasks that heavily use CPU (e.g., calculations, encryption).
   - Threads spend most of their time doing computation.
   - Example: Image resizing, data transformation.

2. **I/O-bound tasks**  
   - Tasks that wait for external resources like disk or network I/O.
   - Threads spend time waiting for file reads, DB queries, etc.
   - Example: Reading files, inserting into DB, calling APIs.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Thread Count vs CPU Cores

Yes, the number of threads should ideally be **aligned with your hardware**, especially the **number of available CPU cores**.

But this depends on the **type of task**:

| Task Type     | Optimal Thread Count Strategy |
|---------------|-------------------------------|
| **CPU-bound** | ~ Equal to number of **logical CPUs** (cores √ó hyperthreading) |
| **I/O-bound** | Can be **higher than logical CPUs**, because threads are often waiting |

### üîç How to Find Logical CPUs in Java
```java
int processors = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors();
System.out.println("Available processors (logical cores): " + processors);
```

This gives you the number of **logical cores** (including hyper-threaded ones), which is a good starting point.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Suggested Thread Pool Sizes

Here‚Äôs a rule-of-thumb guide:

| Task Type       | Formula                        | Example (8-core machine) |
|------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------|
| CPU-bound        | `N_threads = N_cores`          | 8 threads                |
| I/O-bound        | `N_threads = N_cores * 2`      | 16 threads               |
| Mixed workload   | Between N_cores and 2√óN_cores  | 12 threads               |

> ‚úÖ But always **benchmark and adjust** based on actual performance!

---

## üß™ Practical Tips

### 1. Start Small, Scale Up
- Begin with `N_cores` threads.
- Monitor CPU usage and throughput.
- If CPU isn‚Äôt maxed out but I/O is busy ‚Üí increase threads gradually.

### 2. Use Fixed Thread Pools
```java
int corePoolSize = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors() * 2;
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(corePoolSize);
```

### 3. Avoid Oversubscription
Too many threads can cause:
- Context-switching overhead
- Increased memory usage
- Thread contention
- Reduced performance

### 4. Consider Virtual Threads (Java 21+)
If you're using **Java 21 or higher**, consider **Virtual Threads**:
```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor();
```
These are lightweight threads, perfect for high-concurrency I/O work.

## üìà Real World Banking Scenario (Your Case)

Since your project involves:
- File reading (I/O)
- Database inserts (I/O)
- Possibly light parsing (some CPU)

‚û°Ô∏è You‚Äôre dealing with an **I/O-bound** workload.

### üí° Recommended Starting Point:
```java
int poolSize = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors() * 2; // e.g., 16 threads
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(poolSize);
```

Then monitor:
- File processing rate
- DB insert latency
- CPU usage
- Memory consumption

You can later tweak the thread count up or down based on what gives you the best throughput without overwhelming the system.

---

## üéØ Final Tip

Always **measure before and after** changing thread counts.

Use simple logging:
```java
long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
processFile(file);
long end = System.currentTimeMillis();
System.out.println("Processed " + file.getName() + " in " + (end - start) + " ms");
```

Or better yet, use tools like:
- VisualVM
- JConsole
- Micrometer / Prometheus (for production-grade metrics)
